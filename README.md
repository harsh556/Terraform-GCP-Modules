# Terraform GCP Modules

This repository contains a collection of reusable Terraform modules for provisioning and managing various Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources.

These modules are built leveraging [Google's Cloud Foundation Toolkit (CFT)](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-toolkit) and the [Google Fast Fabric](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-fabric/tree/master) repository. They are designed to follow Google‚Äôs recommended best practices for security, scalability, and maintainability.

## üìê Purpose

- Promote modular, consistent, and secure infrastructure-as-code practices
- Ensure alignment with Google's Cloud Architecture Framework and security standards
- Accelerate infrastructure deployment on GCP using Terraform

## üß© Module Structure

Each GCP resource has its own directory under the `modules/` folder, containing:
- A reusable Terraform module
- A dedicated `README.md` with usage instructions
- Optionally, examples and test configurations
